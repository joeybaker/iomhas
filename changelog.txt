	* enable admins to change display settings
	* enable caption editing

* build a homepage
* enable set URL to permalink on click.
* create a 'shopping cart'

IDEAS:
* make thumb size relative to window size

COMPLETED:
* build permalinks

KNOWN ISSUES
* If you have third party cookies disabled in Firefox, Facebook Like buttons do not work. This is a Facebook problem, and there's nothing we can do about it.
* If the window is too large, infinitescroll will not fire. This has been partly addressed by forcing it to fire once on page load, but very likely it should be set to fire everytime there is no scroll bar.
